🔥 &nbsp; Optional build time transforms to improve performance

💪 &nbsp; Type-safe styles via [csstype](https://github.com/frenic/csstype)

🧩 &nbsp; Uses Atomic CSS to reuse styles and avoid specificity issues with CSS

📝 &nbsp; _Experimental_ CSS extraction with [Webpack plugin](./packages/webpack-extraction-plugin)
