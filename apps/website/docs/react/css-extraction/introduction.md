# Introduction

:::caution

This technology is experimental, please [report any issues](https://github.com/microsoft/griffel/issues) if found.

:::

While [ahead-of-time compilation allows](/react/ahead-of-time-compilation/introduction) performs optimization to reduce runtime work, the goal of CSS extraction is to remove runtime insertion to DOM and produce CSS stylesheets.

## When to use it?

It's designed to be used **only** in applications.

## How it works

The tool relies on assets transformed by [ahead-of-time compilation](/react/ahead-of-time-compilation/introduction), its usage is a **prerequisite**. CSS extraction transforms code to remove generated CSS from JavaScript files and create CSS assets.

_Currently, all CSS rules will be extracted to a single CSS file i.e. [code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) for extracted CSS **will not work**._
